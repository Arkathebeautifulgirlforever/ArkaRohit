        <h3> Hi! </h3>

        <p>

            My hobby is reading books. I like books very much especialy "Science", it's my favourite subject it have 4 different parts. But I know only "Chemistry". Reading books is a good habit we all know, but reading books everytime is not a good habit also! Because whenever we read books, after somedays like 10-15 days we want to read a new chapter after reading a new chater we again want to read one new. From this habit we all finish our book's chapters and whenever our teachers read it, we not show any special interest. We all look at the clock to ring to wait for the next subject. No, I am not telling to don't read any books but I'm telling to not read everytime. You should start reading at morning 8:00 am or 8o' clock and finish at 10:30 am or half-past 10', where as in evening start at 6:00 pm or 6o' clock and finish at 9:30 pm or half-past 9. </p>
